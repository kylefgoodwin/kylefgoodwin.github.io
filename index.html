        <p>
          Hello! I'm Kyle, a new developer focusing on front-end web technologies like HTML and CSS. I'm building this page as my first personal portfolio to track my progress and share projects I'm working on. I'm currently interested in learning JavaScript and eventually working on mobile app development.

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, and reading science fiction novels. Feel free to connect with me!
